# Analysis and comparison of the outcome of different models on the Bristol Airbnb listing for price prediction.
Assignment for deep learning for Bristol Airbnb listings.

In this analysis, a complete end to end machine learning project is implemented using the Bristol Airbnb Lisings dataset. The aim of the analysis is to provide a comarison of the results of different regression models that can be used to do predictions on the prices of the listings.

Many sources depict machine learning to be more of a trial and error approach rather than a one- shot single solution method. The following project analyses this hypothisis by applying the different models of machine learning on the sample case of Bristol Airbnb listing.
